# Tri-objective combinatorial optimization problems

The paper consider instances for tri-objective combinatorial (binary) optimization
problems. Problem classes considered are Knapsack (KP), Assignment (AP), Facility Location (FLP)
and IP (general problems with a mixture of constraints and binary variables). [Other problem classes?]


## Test instances

Instances are named `Forget20_[problemClass]_[n]_[p]_[rangeOfCosts]_[costGenerationMethod]_[constaintId]_[id].raw` where 

   - `problemClass` is either KP (knapsack problem), AP (assignment problem), FLP (facility
      location problem) or IP (integer problem with binary variables).
   - `n` is the size of the problem. 
   - `p` is the number of objectives.
   - `rangeOfCosts`: Objective coefficient range e.g. 1-1000.
   - `costGenerationMethod`: Either random, spheredown, sphereup or 2box. For further details see 
      the documentation function `genSample` in the R package 
      [gMOIP](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gMOIP).
   - `constaintId`: Same id if constraints are the same.
   - `id`: Instance id running within the constraint id.

### Raw format description 

All instance files are given in raw format. An example for a knapsack problem is:

```
15 1 3 15 45

maxsum maxsum maxsum

```

The general format is defined as: 

```
n m p nonZeroA nonZeroC

objectiveTypes

objectiveCoefficientMatrix

constraintMatrix

rHSMatrix
```

where:

   - `n` is the number of variables.
   - `m` is the number of constrains.
   - `p` is the number of objectives.
   - `nonZeroA` is the number of non-zero entries in the constraint matrix.
   - `nonZeroC` is the number of non-zero objective coefficients in the objective matrix.
   - `objectiveTypes` is the nature of the objectives to be optimized. An identifier should be 
   added for each objective, and it should be done in the same order as in the objective matrix. 
   Four types are supported:
      	* maxsum: maximise a sum objective function
      	* minsum: minimise a sum objective function
      	* maxmin: maximise a min objective function
      	* minmax: minimise a max objective function
   - `objectiveCoefficientMatrix` is a p x n matrix defining the coefficients of the objective functions
   - `constraintMatrix` is a m x n matrix defining the coefficients of the constraints
   - `rHSMatrix` is a m x 2 matrix defining the right-hand side of the constraints. 
   For each constraint, two numbers are required:
      * The second number is the actual value of the right-hand side of the constraint
      * The first number is an identifier that is used to define the sign of the constraint. 
      Three identifiers can be used: 0 for >= constraints, 1 for <= constraints and 2 for = constraints.
